* Introduction

Large system deployments tend to get very complex. In this document we
explain the GeneNetwork deployment system which is based on GNU Guix
(see Pjotr's [[https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/README.md][Guix-notes]]).

* Binary deployment

NYA (will go to README)

* From source deployment

GNU Guix allows for [[https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/REPRODUCIBLE.org][reproducible deployment]] based on a checked out
Guix repository - use gn-stable for that:

#+begin_src sh   :lang bash
mkdir genenetwork
cd genenetwork
git clone https://github.com/genenetwork/guix.git -b gn-stable gn-stable-guix
git clone https://github.com/genenetwork/guix-bioinformatics.git -b gn-stable
#+end_src

Next build guix (and run) following the instructions in [[https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/INSTALL.org#building-gnu-guix-from-source-using-guix][guix-notes]].

Once that is done we can add the guix-bioinformatics path with

: env GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH=../guix-bioinformatics command

So

#+begin_src sh   :lang bash
#+begin_src sh   :lang bash
gn-stable-guix$ env GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH=../guix-bioinformatics ./pre-inst-env guix package -A genenetwork
genenetwork1    1.0-d622c803b   out     ../guix-bioinformatics/gn/packages/bioinformatics.scm:163:2
genenetwork2    2.0-9e9475053   out     ../guix-bioinformatics/gn/packages/bioinformatics.scm:215:2
#+end_src sh   :lang bash

Install with

#+begin_src sh   :lang bash
gn-stable-guix$ env GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH=../guix-bioinformatics ./pre-inst-env guix package -i genenetwork2
#+end_src sh   :lang bash

* Create archive

: env GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH=../../genenetwork/guix-bioinformatics/ ./pre-inst-env guix archive --export -r genenetwork2 > guix_gn2-2.0-9e9475053.nar
